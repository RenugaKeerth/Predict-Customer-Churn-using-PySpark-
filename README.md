# Predict-Customer-Churn-using-PySpark-
Predicting customer churn is a challenging and common problem that data scientists encounter these days. The ability to predict that a particular customer is at a high risk of churning, while there is still time to do something about it, represents a huge additional potential revenue source for every customer-facing business. This solution will be realized with Apache Spark. Apache Spark is a popular distributed data processing engine which provides a stack of libraries including Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, MLlib for machine learning and GraphX for graph processing. For this project, we will focus on the machine learning library MLlib. We will use the Python API for Spark known as PySpark.
